# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe Desktop App

This is my first personal project outside of a hackathon! It's a simple Tic Tac Toe desktop application built using the **Electron.js** framework. It is designed to be cross-platform (Mac, Linux, and Windows), but I've only tested it on macOS. If you run into issues setting this up locally, let me know and I can alter the instructions.
